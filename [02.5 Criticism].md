This story has potential, but it’s bogged down by "telling" instead of "showing."  We get a lot of exposition and summary, but very little actual action or dialogue. Here's a brutal but hopefully helpful critique:

**Chapter 4: The Fairness Formula**

* **Too Much Telling:**  We hear about Jaz’s transformation, her confidence, the respect she commands, and the effect it has on Bo.  But we don’t *see* any of this.  Instead of telling us she's confident, show us a confident Jaz.  How does she walk? How does she interact with others? What are her words like?
* **Passive Bo:** Bo's internal struggle is mostly summarized. We need to *see* his emotions through his actions, his expressions, his words. He's reacting, but we don't feel his anger, guilt, or shame.
* **Unrealistic Dialogue:**  "What is this, Jaz? What's going on?" is a weak line.  His outburst seems less like a desperate plea and more like a confused child asking "What's for dinner?"  We need more nuanced dialogue to capture the emotional weight of the moment.
* **Expository Speech:** Jaz's speech feels like a TED Talk, delivered to an audience of strangers.  Even if it's a pivotal moment, it’s flat and lacks the emotional impact it should have.  We need to feel her pain, her vulnerability, her hope.
* **Dramatic Irony:** The reveal of Bo's infidelities is anticlimactic.  We've been told it's coming, and the "game" metaphor is heavy-handed.  Instead, show the audience his actions, let them infer the truth, and allow for a more impactful reveal.
* **Clichéd Conclusion:**  "This," she said, her gaze sweeping across the room, "is the Fairness Formula."  This is the kind of line you see in cheesy self-help books.  Jaz’s vision needs to be more subtle, more emotionally resonant, and less like a brand name.

**Chapter 5: The Pact**

* **Descriptive Dump:**  "The applause faded, leaving behind an unsettling silence. Bo stood alone in the center of the room, a ghost amidst the departing guests. His mind raced..."  This is more telling, and it doesn’t show Bo’s emotional state.  We need to see his physical reactions, his facial expressions, how he interacts with the environment. 
* **Unrealistic Dialogue:** "I'm sorry."  "I know what I did was wrong."  These are weak apologies. They lack nuance and don't convey the full weight of his actions.  Bo's regret needs to be more visceral.
* **Missing Tension:**  "A flicker of understanding crossed Jaz's eyes."  This is a missed opportunity for tension and conflict.  Does she *really* understand?  How does she react to his apology?
* **Deus Ex Machina:**  Jaz's week-long role reversal feels like a convenient plot device, not a natural progression of their conflict. Why does Jaz think this is the solution? Why does Bo agree so easily? 
* **Lack of Stakes:**  The "Fairness Pact" is introduced, but we don't understand what's at stake. What happens if Bo fails? How will the pact change their lives? We need to feel the pressure, the consequences of their choices.

**Overall Issues**

* **Lack of Show, Don't Tell:**  The story relies heavily on summary and exposition.  We’re told about the characters’ emotions and motivations, but we don't see them in action.
* **Weak Dialogue:**  The dialogue is predictable and often lacks emotional resonance.  Focus on making it more natural, more evocative of the characters' emotional states.
* **Unrealistic Character Development:**  Bo's sudden transformation seems too quick and easy.  His change needs to be more gradual, more believable.
* **Predictable Plot:**  The overall plot follows a predictable formula: conflict, revelation, reconciliation.  There's a lack of surprise and intrigue. 

**How to Improve**

* **Focus on Action and Dialogue:**  Show us Jaz’s transformation through her actions.  Show us Bo’s inner turmoil through his physical reactions, his words, and his interactions with others.
* **Develop Realistic Characters:**  Make them flawed, make them complex, and give them conflicting motivations.  Avoid making them simply good or bad.
* **Create Conflict and Stakes:**  What are the consequences of Bo’s actions?  What will happen if Jaz doesn’t believe him?  What happens if their “Fairness Pact” fails? 
* **Engage Your Reader with Sensory Details:**  Use vivid imagery, evocative language, and sensory details to bring the story to life. 

Remember, your goal is to create a story that is immersive and emotionally engaging.  Show, don't tell, and let your characters lead you to a compelling and unpredictable conclusion.
